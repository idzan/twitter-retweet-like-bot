# Python Bot for Twitter - Favorite(Like) and Retweet of Web Terms
 Small Twitter bot which can like and retweet tweets which have search terms in it.

### Detailed Description of project

This project was created as one small hobby idea within 20 minutes. First I found idea on Dev Ed YouTube Channel where he explained how it works and what are prerequisites for this kind of project. Project is built in Python (obviously) with Tweepy library and it uses Twitter's own API calls to make Likes (Favorites) of Tweets and Retweets of them for couple of Web Development Terms. It is running on AWS EC2 instance, where it is configured using Cron job to run all day long and to make Retweets and Favorites until it get to Daily Limits for API Calls. Twitter Account which is running this script is @webtermsbot.

**Using tweepy library and official Twitter Developer API**

**Follow it on Twitter (working account)**
